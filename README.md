# matrix-calculator

## Description

This is a simple matrix calculator that can perform most matrix/vector operations. Data processing executes on the server, which is written in Python and uses Numpy for the matrix operations. So you can implement your own matrix operation quite easily (if you need it).

## Operations
```
1. Addition: add(A, B)
2. Subtraction: subtract(A, B)
3. Matrix Transposition: transpose(A)
4. Dot Product: dot(vA, vB)
5. Cross Product: cross(vA, vB)
6. Matrix Inversion: inverse(A)
7. Determinant Computation: det(A) 
```
